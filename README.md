# Analyzing-ISRO-Sea-Surface-Dataset

This project explores Sea Level Rise trends in the North Pacific Oceanic Region using a **satellite-based dataset** provided by **ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)**, thanks to Dr. Neeraj Agarwal to give us this opportunity. The dataset spans 30 years (1993â€“2022) and was provided in NetCDF (.nc) format under the name ALL_MONTHLY_SLA_1993-2022.nc. (Since the dataset is huge, I couldn't attach it here)

The project's goal was to leverage technology and use python to analyse and visualize trends. how sea levels have changed over time in the region, and identify key environmental parameters influencing this trend, such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Salinity, and Ice Melt Indicator.

## Objectives
Analyze temporal (over time) and spatial (over region) trends in sea level.
Visualize key oceanographic variables from the dataset.
Derive meaningful climate-related inferences.
Forecast possible future trends based on historical data.

-> Dataset Used
Source: ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)
File Name: ALL_MONTHLY_SLA_1993-2022.nc
Contents: Monthly measurements of Sea Level Anomalies and related parameters across global oceans.

## What We Did
Region Selection: Focused on the North Pacific Ocean as the primary area of interest.
Data Extraction: Parsed and filtered relevant variables such as:
-> Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
->Salinity
->Sea Level Anomaly (SLA)

## Visualization:
Created both spatial plots (across the map) and temporal plots (over years).
Used color-coded maps to show patterns over the ocean surface.
